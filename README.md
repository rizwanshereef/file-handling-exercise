# File Handling Exercise  


## Problem1
**Problem Statement: Read and add content to a file**

- Given a filename and content read the file and add the content in the file using fileInputStream and try with resources

- This exercise contains a class named FileEdition with the following method:
     **fileEditor(String, String) : String** 
     -	Should take two String values as input and return a string as result
     -	Should validate the input by checking whether it is null,empty or blank space
     -	Should append the second string, content in the file with file name, first string     
     -	Should also handle exceptions thrown by logic using try with resources and catch      

 ***Example:***
    Sample Input:
    text.txt, Abraham Lincoln      
    
    Expected Output:
    Hi my name is Abraham Lincoln
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    test , Bill Clinton
        
    Expected Output:
    File 'test' not Found

## Problem2
**Problem Statement: Read the content from the given file(input.txt) and write the result to another file(output.txt) without redundant lines ##**

- Given a file by name input.txt, read content using FileInputStream and write result to file by name output.txt by using FileOutputStream

- This exercise contains a class named RemoveDuplicateLines with the following method:

    +**removeDuplicateLines( ) : void**
    - Should read content line by line from input.txt 
    - Should write result to output.txt 
        
 ***Example:***
    Sample Input:
    
    input.txt
    JVM
    JRE
    JDK
    JRE
    JVM
    
    Expected Output:   
    
    output.txt
    JVM
    JRE
    JDK

## Problem 3
 ***Problem Statement: Transfer data from one file to another***

- Given two file names read the first file and add the content in the second file using bufferedStream and handle exception using throws

- This exercise contains a class named FileMigration with the following method:

     +***fileContentDuplicator(String, String) : String***  
     - Should take two String values as input and return a string as result
     - Should validate the input String by checking whether it is null or empty   
     - Should return an Error String when the file is empty or blank space       
     - Should read data from file of name first String using bufferedInputStream and write in file of name second String using bufferedOutputStream       

***Example:***

    Sample Input:
    text.txt, testBackup.txt      
    
    Expected Output:
    Hi my name is
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    test , testBackup.txt
        
    Expected Output:
    Throw IOException
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    test.txt , null
        
    Expected Output:
    Given fileName to read or write is empty, null or blank space
